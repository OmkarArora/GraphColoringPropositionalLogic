Graph Coloring using Propositional Logic
	- This project uses propositional logic to solve the Graph Coloring problem.
	  The graph coloring problem consists of a graph whose nodes need to be colored in a way that 
	  neighbouring nodes don't have the same color and the number of colours used are minimum.
	  The problem can also be seen in a way that, for the given graph and number of colors, is it 
	  possible to color the graph with the given colors with the above mentioned constraint that
	  no neighbouring nodes can have the same color. 

Inputs
	- The program takes the adjacency matrix of the graph and the number of colors as input.

Output
	- The program returns all the possible color combinations of the nodes of the graph.

Running the code
	- Enclosed is a java project which can be imported to an IDE or view the java code directly from 
	  the src folder of the project.

Concepts Used
	- The graph coloring problem is reduced to the satisfiability problem to construct a
	  propositional logic clause.
